<h3>Bios</h3>

<p>
    The natural world fascinates me. I spend much of my spare time hiking and observing plants over the seasons. This leads me to classifying and familiarizing myself with
    the habits of the things I often see. This     <a href="https://github.com/christophercampbell/bios">project</a> is a data driven app that graphs the classification.

    I post pictures of flowers and mushrooms at <a href="https://christophercampbell.github.io">perobscurus</a>
